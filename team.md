This is Mahim Choudhury. I am currently enrolled in BU’s online software development master’s program. Professionally, I am an engineer coming from the defense industry with 3 years of experience. I have a background of electrical engineering with focus on embedded electronics. However, over the past 2 years, I have started to dive into software engineering field from both academically and professionally and I have been gaining valuable software development experiences from there. I have experience in Java, python, nodejs, javascript and have worked on an online shopping cart, a personal biography website, and a health management app(in java) as part of the previous courses in this master’s program. I am looking forward to gaining new insights from this course and hopefully becoming proficient in this field of engineering.
